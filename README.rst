A basic WebGIS Example
========================

This is a basic WebGIS example based on GeoExt 2

How to run it
------------

1) At first you have to install Apache HTTP web server and git.
To succeed that, in Ubuntu you have to type in a terminal the following command::
    
    $ sudo apt-get install apache2 git

2) After that, type::
  
    $ cd /var/www/html
    $ sudo git clone https://github.com/Gpetrak/basic_webgis_example

3) Open a browser and navigate to the following link::

    http://localhost/basic_webgis_example/basic_webgis.html

If all the staff has been built successfully, you should see the webGIS interface.

4) To visualize layers on the map, you have to install GeoServer and publish your data in there. Follow the link: http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/ for the instructions.

5) When you have published your data in GeoServer, take a look in my_map.js file and pay attention to the following pieces of code::
    
    new OpenLayers.Layer.WMS("layer_title",
        "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wms", {
         layers: "layer_name",
         transparent: true,
         format: "image/png"
         }, {      
            isBaseLayer: false,     
            visibility: false,
            projection:new OpenLayers.Projection("EPSG:900913"),
            buffer: 0
            }
         ),

Replace:
 
layer_title with the title of the specific layer


layer_name with the layer's name just like it has been stored in GeoServer

Now you should visualize your data on the webGIS example !
